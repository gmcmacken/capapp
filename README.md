**cap***app*
============

A webapp for aiding treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia. To be rolled out to app stores..

Currently under development in co-ordination with Dr. McMacken and the South Eastern Health &amp; Social Care Trust.

### Technical Info

Quick app using JQuery Mobile, Phonegap and Socket.io.

Uses WebSockets to push results to a central node.js server to keep track and offer instant, streaming audit results. This section could (should) be improved. Was a nice way to play with node.js/socket.io/d3.js though.
